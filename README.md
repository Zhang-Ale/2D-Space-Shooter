**Read before play**<br>
There are 2 modes: singleplayer and multiplayer (currently only 2 players allowed). The singleplayer mode uses keyboard as inputs, while the multiplayer mode requires an Arduino board to be connected to the computer as the second input source. The Arduino board needs to have a Potentiometer and a Button connected on it in order to play, and in Arduino software try different Serial Port connections. (Idk if there's a better way to do it)

# How to play
**On singleplayer:** <br>
WASD to move, Space to shoot.<br>
<br>
**On multiplayer:** <br> 
Player1 (Arduino): rotate Potentiometer to move, and press Button to shoot.<br>
Player2 (Keyboard): press WASD to move, and Space to shoot.<br>
