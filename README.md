*2D Space Shooter<br>

**Read before play**<br>
There are 2 modes: single-player and multi-player (currently only 2 players allowed). The single-player mode uses the computer's keyboard as input, while the multi-player mode requires an Arduino board to be connected to the computer as the second input source. The Arduino board needs to have a Potentiometer and a Button connected to it to play, and in Arduino software try different Serial Port connections. (Idk if there's a better way to do it)

# How to play
**On single-player:** <br>
WASD to move, Space to shoot.<br>
<br>
**On multi-player:** <br> 
Player1 (Arduino): rotate the Potentiometer to move, and press the Button to shoot.<br>
Player2 (Keyboard): press WASD to move, and Space to shoot.<br>
